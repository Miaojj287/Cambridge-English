Around the fourteenth century, acquiring large libraries became common among the European aristocracy,creating a growing demand for books. For the rapid copying of many texts, scholars in the Italian city of Florence developed a cursive script of linked letters that did not require the quill (pen made from a bird feather)to be lifted from the page as each letter was completed. The activity of these scholars successfully encouraged further competitive book collecting among European rulers. Alongside ancient Greek and Roman authors,which were in fashion throughout Europe at the time,aristocratic buyers accumulated religious texts, New genres intended purely for entertainment, such as chronicle histories and chivalric romances, grew in popularity and contributed to the very considerable size of libraries owned by princes at the time. 

By the mid-fifteenth century the European book market was already very large. Aristocratic collecting opened up new markets for scribes and booksellers, and the expansion of the European university network increased traditional demand among scholars and students. The expanding functions of government required more notaries, secretaries, and literate public officials,stimulating a rapid growth in the number of schools. All of these required books, competing for a supply of the precious raw material-parchment, the thin, dried skin of some animals-on which books depended. Parchment was expensive and the supply relatively fixed; there were only so many suitable animals to be skinned. The continued expansion of the book market would have been halted if it had not been possible to find a cheaper.more plentiful alternative. 

Paper was an invention of the Eastern cultures, where it had been known and used for many centuries. It entered Europe via the Middle East and Islamic Spain, where the process of manufacture was mastered in the twelfth century. The raw material, before the introduction of ...left a sheet which could be removed and dried to create paper. 

This was a complex and intricate operation, demanding considerable skill to capture the right thickness of the resulting substance. The process needed an abundance of running water to power the hammers that smashed the rags. Obviously it also required access to a steady supply of suitable waste clothing. These were conditions that existed in or close to many of Europe's largest centers of population, and soon the process was spreading far beyond Spain. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, paper mills were established in northern Italy and southern Germany as well as in Normandy and Champagne in France. These locations were strategically close to the major urban centers that made most use of parchment. Soon paper became an acceptable substitute, especially for the more mundane purposes of bookkeeping and correspondence. Initially there was some resistance to the use of paper in books. Parchment was more hard-wearing and, especially for a richly illuminated or decorated text, the shiny surface of parchment continued to be preferred. But paper was also hardy and durable, as anyone who has handled a book made with the fine rag-based paper of the fifteenth century will testify. It was also more flexible, less brittle, and more easily folded. Sheets were even and regular,and stacked well for transportation. Soon large quantities were being traded, especially into the chillier lands of northern Europe where the prevalence of woolen clothing restricted the supply of suitable rags.
